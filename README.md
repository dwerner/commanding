I am aware of puppet, but that seems a bit too heavyweight for me. I also wanted some experience writing 'shell-like' scripts in python for cross-platform concerns.

Ruby is an excellent choice when building a near-perfect DSL, but I don't want a DSL, really.

I want a tool that, with the least effort at install time, will install all the tools that I have come to use on a daily basis, along with my custom configuration for them.
